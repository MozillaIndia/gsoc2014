                                        Localization plays a major role in Mozilla in spreading its vision of an open and literate web. Localizers are major contributors in making the open source products from Mozilla like Firefox and websites available in 30+ languages, this involves a lot of data being generated in the translation followed by a review process of these translated string. The project aims to use existing database of translations for a particular string and use rating factors and other rating methods to figure out the best translation to a particular string. Also this project can use automatic translation since the data generated by the users over many years can be used for mining and then processing for translation of strings.<br/><br/>
                                        This project could also be used in localization of the documentation present on MDN into different languages for the world to use. A feed can be built onto MDN requesting the to be localized content as paragraphs of data and then localizing them using the automatic localization features.<br/><br/>

                                        <strong><u>Solution</u></strong><br><br>
                                        Using inotify or watchman, keep track of the files being changed in the source dirs.
                                        This can be done in two ways:
                                        <br><br>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li> Directly integrate it with mach and provide it with a mode where it reads the last-updated files from a log of the daemon. Possibly provide a separate but similar system for qref</li>
                                            <li> Or, integrate it with qref (some partial solutions for this already exist), possibly as a Mercurial extension. Now, make hg read the files to be changed from the active patch. This only deals with changes being added, if a patch is popped or a change is removed from a patch, there needs to be a mechanism to notice this as well</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <br>
                                        This will also require the improvement of mach so that it knows whe to build a file and when to build a folder. Generally js and xul builds have to be done at the folder level.
                                        
                                        <br>
                                        Additional speed and usability improvements to the patching system can be done as well.
                                        <br>
                                        <strong><u>Benefit</u></strong> <br>Faster patching, building, and testing, thus saving time.

                                        Currently Firefox OS doesn't support the use of HTTP PROXY / HTTPS PROXY in its WiFi settings. This is filed as <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=973872" target="_blank"> Bug 973872 </a>. Lots of corporates use proxy connections internally for serving the internet. Implementing this feature will help students in large universities and organizations to use the phones and the Firefox OS.
